# 0.3.0

This release changes Ident to support blank ("_") names in some places:

* function arguments (inputs and outputs)
* struct field names
* union field names
* tagged variant field names

If any of those has such a field, the compiler will rewrite them
to have autogenerated names like field0 or arg2 (exact format not guaranteed),
and the Ident will be marked with `was_blank: true`

It also adds fields_were_all_blank to `StructTy` and `TaggedVariantTy` which
can be used to determine they should be generated as tuple-structs/tuple-variants.
This allows e.g. abi-cafe's Rust backend to generate these.


# 0.2.1

Minor release to update dependencies and docs.


# 0.2.0

Got a lot of the parser and type system implemented, can now do all the kinds of type
I want and do name resolution and compute the order of declarations and stuff. Lots
of random parts still stubbed out.

Error handling still a big ??? as I punted on multiple error handling.

Some spans for types are garbage.

Hopefully usable for abi-cafe in 0.3.0!



# 0.1.0

Initial Fucked Up Hack!
